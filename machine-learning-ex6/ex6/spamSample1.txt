Dear Friends,

This is to let you know that all reviews for 444 abstracts are now complete and all authors have been notified accordingly.  I want to say loudly a heartfelt THANK YOU to the reviewers and of course all of you for the hard work in preparing many excellent abstracts.

If you are a corresponding author and did not receive a notification please let us know immediately and we will investigate and rectify any issues.

In early February 2018 you will be notified of the registration web site opening by email and through the conference website.  In early April 2018 we will finalize the program and inform you by email and through the website (IATBR2018.org).


With my best wishes for a Happy 2018,

Kostas Goulias
Chair, IATBR2018
