This repository contains my programming assignments codes for the excellent [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) class taught at Coursera by Professor Andrew NG.

Each directory contains the week assignment codes, which is written in [GNU Octave's](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) programming language.
